# [`cms`](https://github.com/cms-dev/cms) dockerized

## Setting up
-------------------
services:
`db` and `cms_dev`.

Build and run:
```shellsession
foo@cms-test$ cd cms-dev/
foo@cms-dev$ docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up --build
```
_(This should show the logs for the database)_

In another terminal, run:
```shellsession
foo@cms-dev$ docker compose exec cms_dev bash
```
Now this should start an interactive shell for cms.
Config file used is `config/cms.conf.docker.sample` to set the right host and port to connect to the database (`db:5432`). The user is set to cmsuser:cmsuser.

Run the script to check environment for isolate (used for sandboxes):
```shellsession
cmsuser@~/cms$ ./isolate-check-environment
```
______

The first 4 tests are enough to pass for isolate to work properly (to use --cg - [See documentation](https://www.ucw.cz/moe/isolate.1.html)

If they don't pass, you should set the kernel parameters from `cmdline.txt` on your host machine.
You can't set them with sysctl. Edit `/etc/default/grub` by adding the line from `cmdline.txt`.
Then run:
```shellsession
foo@/$ sudo update-grub
foo@/$ sudo reboot
```

Run the following commands to create a new user & database:

_(if you don't want to modify cms.conf, let password be cmsuser)_
```shellsession
cmsuser@~/cms$ createuser -h db -p 5432 --username=postgres --pwprompt cmsuser
createdb -h db -p 5432 --username=postgres --owner=cmsuser cmsdb
```
Grant permissions to user:
```shellsession
cmsuser@~/cms$ psql -h db -p 5432 --username=postgres --dbname=cmsdb --command='ALTER SCHEMA public OWNER TO cmsuser'
cmsuser@~/cms$ psql  -h db -p 5432 --username=postgres --dbname=cmsdb --command='GRANT SELECT ON pg_largeobject TO cmsuser'
```
______

Create the database schema for CMS:
```shellsession
cmsuser@~/cms$ cmsInitDB
```
Create your admin account:
```shellsession
cmsuser@~/cms$ cmsAddAdmin your_username -p your_password
```
Start web server for admin:
```shellsession
cmsuser@~/cms$ cmsAdminWebServer
```
In your web browser, navigate to [http://localhost:8889](http://localhost:8889) and enter your admin credentials.

To see logs of all the services running:
```shellsession
cmsuser@~/cms$ cmsLogService 0
```

Start all services:
```shellsession
cmsuser@~/cms$ cmsResourceService -a
```

After configuring a contest, you can manually add a user by using the web interface.

They can log in with their credentials at:
[http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888).


## Contest Filesystem
_____________

I cloned an example for the italian import format (in `con_test-master`). The loader was pre-installed in cms.
To see more about configuration of a contest for this filesystem, see the [doc](https://cms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/External%20contest%20formats.html#italian-import-format).

To start a contest, go to `con_test-master` and run:
```shellsession
cmsuser@~/cms/con_test-master$ cmsImportUser --all -L italy_yaml .
cmsuser@~/cms/con_test-master$ cmsImportContest -i -L italy_yaml 
```

## Done! ðŸ¤
